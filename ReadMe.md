<h2><b>🔹About </b></h2>
<p>
Hello guys!🙌🏻 My name is PEI-HSUAN SU, Phoebe! I have finished Level 4 FullStack Developer course, and currently studying in Level 5 Software Development at Mission Ready HQ Auckland, New Zealand. In mid-February, I will be jumping into an internship and gaining more industry experience.
Currently, I am the Assistant Trainer for Level 4 course in Mission Ready. I hold a buddy group to guide, support students and answer their questions.

I am also trying to do some small projects, following an online tutorial, and reviewing what I have learnt.
